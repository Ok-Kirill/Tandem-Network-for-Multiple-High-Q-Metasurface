# Tandem-Network-for-Multiple-High-Q-Metasurface

The project is devoted to design of nonlinear optical metasurfaces through engineering of multiple resonances in metasurfaces' transmittance spectra.
The design of metasurface and the whole dataset were created in commercial Maxwell equations solver (ANSYS Lumerical).

The code for generation of dataset is attached as Dataset generation.lsf or Dataset generation code.txt files.

The dataset consisted from more then 2000 samples is also attached as two archives a-Si MS for TN 1103 samples.rar and a-Si MS for TN 1150 samples.rar.

Both neural networks (forward and backward) comprising the Tandem Network can be disclosed here as Tandem_Network.ipynb.

The Lumerical project for calculating the metasurface transmission spectra is attached as a_Si Ms for TN.fsp file.
