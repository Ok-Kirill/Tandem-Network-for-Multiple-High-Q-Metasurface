# Tandem-Network-for-Multiple-High-Q-Metasurface

The project is devoted to design of nonlinear optical metasurfaces through engineering of multiple resonances in metasurfaces' transmittance spectra.
The design of metasurface and the whole dataset were created in commercial Maxwell equations solver (ANSYS Lumerical).

The code for generation of dataset is attached as ...
The dataset consisted from more then 2000 samples is also attached as archive ...
Both neural networks (forward and backward) comprising the Tandem Network can be disclosed here as Tandem_Network.ipynb.
